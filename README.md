# CSIT-AUDIO-PROCESSING

This challenge consists of 3 tasks.

### Task 1: REVERSING AND SPEEEDING UP OF AUDIO
As a warm-up task, participants are given an audio clip that obviously (i) has been slowed down and (ii) is playing backwards. To reverse and speed up the clip, participants can use native reverse and speed-up functions native to most audio processing libraries.

Question: Find a place or location

###  Task 2: VIEWING AUDIO IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN

Participants will note a screeching / chirp-like sound in the Christmas tunes provided, where upon they are hinted to explore different ways to visualise audio data.

Question: Find a time

### Task 3: BAND FILTER WITH FOURIER TRANSFORM
Participants will note a very noisy clip with a slight murmuring (in a foreign language) in the background. If participants were to feed the audio clip directly into a multi-language speech-to-text model, they will obtain the following text (which makes no sense at all).

Question: Find a song
